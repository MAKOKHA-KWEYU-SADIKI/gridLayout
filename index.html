                I received  a job offer mid cource
                , and the subjects i  learned
                were current, if not more so, 
                in the company i joined.
                i honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

             I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some  people
             who hade anamazing experience here. I signed up for 
             for the free intro  course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
             thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling-time of my life.
             Since completing the cource ,I've successfully switched careers, working as a
             software engineer at VR startup"

                  I needed some structure from prophessionals who can help me lear programming
                  step by step.
                  I was encouraged to entrol by a farmer student of theirs
                  who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire carriculumand stuff did not
                   dissapoint. They were very hand-on
                   and I naver had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took took my 
                   learning to the next level in away no tutorial could ever have. In
                   fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                   development experience. It certainly help me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomment!""
